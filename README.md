This project contains the work done in the course "Machine Learning for Human Vision and Language", at Utrecht University.
It is made of three assignments, the first available as a pdf containing theoretical and code sections, the second and the third in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

The first part of the course is about human vision, and the related work consists in the implementation and the analysis of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for image recognition in R (Keras). The pdf document contains the analysis performed and the low-level implementation of the convoultional operations, aimed at a better understanding of DCCNs.

The second part of the course focuses on natural language.
The first of the two related assingments is based on the Glove language model, while the second one concerns sequence processing with recurrent neural network. Both the assignment make use of the PyTorch library.
